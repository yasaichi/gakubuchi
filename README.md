Gakubuchi provides a simple way to manage static pages (e.g. error pages) with Asset Pipeline.

## Installation
Put this in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gakubuchi'
```

Run the installation generator with:

```shell
rails generate gakubuchi:install
```

Or specify the name of directory for static pages:

```shell
rails generate gakubuchi:install -d html
```

They will install the initializer into `config/initializers/gakubuchi.rb` and create the directory in `app/assets`.  
If you don't specify the `-d` option, `templates` will be used as default.

## Usage

In `app/assets/templates/404.html.slim`:

```slim
doctype html
html
  head
    title The page you were looking for doesn't exist (404)
    meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width,initial-scale=1'
    = stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all'
  body
    .dialog
      div
        h1 The page you were looking for doesn't exist.
        p You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved.
      p If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.
```

Open the following URL in your browser to check the templeate:

```
http://localhost:3000/assets/404.html
```

Compile the templeate with:

```shell
rake assets:precompile
```

This will generate `public/404.html`.

## Template engines
Gakubuchi supports some template engines: `ERB`, `Haml` and `Slim`.  
If you want to use `Haml` or `Slim`, you need to put them in your Gemfile:

```ruby
# Use Haml
gem 'haml-rails'

# Use Slim
gem 'slim-rails'
```

## Using assets
Gakubuchi enables you to use assets (e.g. `CSS` or `JavaScript` files) in static pages.  
Note that you may need to add them to the precompile array in `config/initializers/assets.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w(error.css error.js)
```

## Using helpers
You can also use helpers provided by `Sprockets::Rails::Helper` in static pages.   
Examples of them are given below.

* `asset_path`
* `content_tag`
* `favicon_link_tag`
* `image_tag`
* `javascript_include_tag`

If you want to get the list of all available helpers, please execute the following code.

```ruby
Sprockets::Rails::Helper.instance_methods
```

## Using `Gakubuchi::PublicException`

Gakubuchi provides a special exceptions app as `Gakubuchi::PublicException`
that allows digest-named templates (like `public/assets/404-*.html.slim`) themselves to show
error pages.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.exceptions_app = Gakubuchi::PublicExceptions.new(Rails.public_path)
```

Using it, `public/404.html` is no longer needed and you can set copy_templates_to_public to false.

## Configuration
In `config/initializers/gakubuchi.rb`, you can configure the following values.

```
leave_digest_named_templates # false by default
copy_templates_to_public     # true by default
template_directory           # 'templates' by default
```
